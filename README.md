Developed an augmented reality based game in unity and Vuforia engine. This game contains various components like a table ,a boy, flying saucer, aliens. At the start of scene touch sensitive mid air stage projects on the screen the green ball .When we click it the game scene appears with a boy standing idly on table. Then a saucer comes above the table and releases aliens. These aliens try to push man.Man to defend himself he need to throw aliens aways from table. The game has left and right buttons which controls mans movement. As we have used mid air stage, the whole scene projects on air without any support.
